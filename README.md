### Hello! 👋

I'm Jordan- a student currently enrolled at Concordia University studying Full Stack Web Development. Before starting my program, I was a technical specialist at Apple and would occasionally volunteer through the company and other organizations. I'm a pretty big geek, avid video game player and aspiring developer. 👾

### My Values
<ul>
👫 I really enjoy working with others
🙏 I believe trusting your peers is really important
🍎 Constantly willing to try and learn new things
  </ul>

### How I Work

I consider myself to be someone who is very organized and can commit to the projects and tasks that I take on. I've always been a curious person and constantly use the resources presented to me and work with my peers to find answers to the things I do not know. Due to my curiosity, I've always been a creative person and firmly believe there is usually more than one way to solve a problem. Feel free to pick my brain and we'll find out where that goes! 😁
